# 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This exercise involves creating a class called `Entrada`, designed to handle the different exceptions that can occur in Java when entering data via the keyboard using the `Scanner` class.

The goal is to instantiate an object of the `Scanner` class and develop static methods to read different types of data from the keyboard. Additionally, if an exception occurs, it will be handled, and the user will be prompted again until the value is correctly entered.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 11 or later)
- Java Standard Library (`java.util.Scanner`)
- Exception handling in Java (`InputMismatchException`, custom `Exception`)

## 📋 Requirements

- JDK 11 or later installed
- A Java development environment (IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans)
- Basic knowledge of Java and exception handling
